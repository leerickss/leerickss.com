<h1>About Me</h1>

<blockquote>
    I'm a data scientist and an ML engineer interested in:
    - building practical ML systems,
    - applied to problems of scale and complexity that are best tackled by AI/ML algorithms, and
    - have positive meaningful impact. (Or at the very least, useful!)
    <br>
    Previously, I worked on various ML models for recommendation and real time bidding(RTB) in ads at AppLovin, Machine Zone and A9.com(Amazon).
    I studied Statistics/Computaional and Matematical Engineering (M.S) with a focus in data science at Stanford, and Applied Mathematics (B.S) at Columbia.
    I grew up in South Korea and 한국말 잘합니다!

    In my spare time I usually read (currently going through the lists by Naval and Patrick Collison), play tennis and learn music primarily through playing guitar.
